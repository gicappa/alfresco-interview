== Architecture

Generally speaking, I use a DDD approach where the domain module containing the business logic is the bounded context and is connected through the outside world using module adapters (hexagonal/port and adapters architecture).

The software is composed by the following modules:

- fizzbuzz-domain
- fizzbuzz-cli
- fizzbuzz-api
- fizzbuzz-ui
- fizzbuzz-docs

=== fizzbuzz-domain
Is the inner part of the application that sets the behavior of it.

=== fizzbuzz-cli
Is one of the possible primary driver that accepts input and provide outputs. It makes use of the command line to give input and output to the domain.

=== fizzbuzz-api
Is another primary driver that accepts input and provide outputs. It makes use of an Restful API to give input and output to the domain.

=== fizzbuzz-ui
Is the HID to access the API and so give the chance to the humans to access the application

=== fizzbuzz-docs
This documentation.
