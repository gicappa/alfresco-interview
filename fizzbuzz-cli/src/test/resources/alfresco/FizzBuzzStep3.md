## Step 3
### Requirements
Produce a report at the end of the output showing how many times the following were printed:
```
fizz
buzz
fizzbuzz
alfresco
integer
```

### [Example](- "example")
Running the program with a range from 1-[20](- "#end") should produce the following result:

[1 2 alfresco 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz alfresco 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz fizz: 4 buzz: 3 fizzbuzz: 1 alfresco: 2 integer: 10](- "?=fizzBuzzIt(#end)")

(Integer is 10 because there were 10 numbers in the output that were not altered).
