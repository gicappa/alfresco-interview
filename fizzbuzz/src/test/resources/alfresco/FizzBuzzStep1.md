## Step 1

### Requirements
Write code that produces the following output for each number in a contiguous range of integers:

1. the number itself
2. ‘fizz’ for numbers that are multiples of 3
3. ‘buzz’ for numbers that are multiples of 5
4. ‘fizzbuzz’ for numbers that are multiples of 15

Being careful to avoid trailing spaces.


### [Example](- "example c:status=ExpectedToFail")
Running the program with a range from 1-[20](- "#end") should produce the following result:


[1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz](- "?=fizzBuzzIt(#end)")


Init a local git repository and create a commit with the solution.
