## Step 2

### Requirements
Please enhance your existing FizzBuzz solution to perform the following requirements:

- If the number contains a three you must output the text ‘alfresco’, any other rule is skipped.

### [Example](- "example")
Running the program with a range from 1-[20](- "#end") should produce the following result:


[1 2 alfresco 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz alfresco 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz](- "?=fizzBuzzIt2(#end)")

Create a branch for the alfresco variation and then a commit with the solution.
